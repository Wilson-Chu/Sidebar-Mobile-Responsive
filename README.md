# A Responsive Animated CSS Icon Navbar

Based on the Fireship Tutorial found on: [Responsive CSS Navbar](https://youtu.be/biOMz4puGt8)

A mobile-responsive animated navbar using only CSS, no Bootstrap. Very fun to learn about and play around with!
Will likely use this as a reference for when I design my personal project portfolio website...
